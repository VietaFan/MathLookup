        notation:
            span{v_1, v_2, ..., v_n}
            we say that v_1, ..., v_n span span{v_1, v_2, ..., v_n}
        notes:
            the field F might be inportant, since the constants come from F

        notation:
            denoted dim_F(V) or just dim(V) if F is clear from context
            
    theorem:
        let V be a finitely generated vector space, then:
        (i) there exists a finite basis of V
        (ii) if B_1, B_2 are finite bases of V then:
            |B_1| = |B_2|
        so dim_F(V) is well-defined
